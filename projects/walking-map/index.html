                        <p>Walking is one of my favorite activities and forms of exercise. Since January of 2025 I have
                            been tracking my position during my walks and bike rides and recording some extra data too.

                        <p>As I was getting more familiar with ArcGIS Online (AGOL), I decided to start my own little
                            project using ArcGIS Field Maps to track my position while going for walks. As much as I
                            loved the convenience of AGOL and cloud based mapping, eventually I had to port my project
                            to QGIS and QField due to my expiring student license. However, that turned out to be a
                            blessing in disguise as it encouraged me to become more familiar with QGIS and QField which
                            I found to be a nice experience. </p>
                        <p>The first feature I recorded contained only the tracks themselves but slowly I added more and
                            more attributes (table 1) like duration which allowed me to calculate average speed. For
                            science, I
                            considered whether I was walking with someone else (which may affect walking speed) and
                            temperature. I can say that as of September 24 and using 82 samples (when I was walking
                            alone) that my average walking speed is about <b>1.42 m/s</b> or <b>5.12 km/h</b>. These
                            values are for
                            temperatures that range from -29 to +29 degrees celsius and don't consider vertical movement
                            (hilly vs flat area). </p>

                        <p>A possible limitation includes the lack of elevation in the line length measurement which
                            would impact the average speed calculations. However, after deriving z-values from a DEM,
                            calculating the 3D line length and comparing that to the 2D line length a
                            negligible difference was found. Unless I was doing some major hiking, elevation isn't as
                            important. </p>
                        <p>Eventually I decided to start recording horizontal GPS accuracy as m-values which allowed me
                            to find the average accuracy for each feature and the average of all features. To my
                            surprise, the total average GPS horizontal accuracy for 101 features turned out to be 3.38
                            m which seems pretty good. A custom Field Calculator function was written to carry out this

                        <p>What inspired me to write the <a href="../spatiallyorderpoints/index.html">spatially order
                                points</a> tool was my idea to use my average
                            walking speed and the BC road network to create a series of polygons that represent the time
                            it takes to walk to any point along that network from a starting point (my house). In map 2
                            below, I used the intersection of 100th St and 100th Ave to give an example. If I were to
                            start a route from this point, it would take me at least 5 mins to reach the black polygon,
                            10 mins
                            to reach the blue one, and so on. </p>

                        <p>Although one could just use Google Maps to figure out route times, this method works well for
                            a quick reference: if I want to keep the walk within 30 mins then I know not to exceed the
                            teal or 15 min polygon (as it takes 15 mins to get there and 15 mins to get back). </p>
                        <p>Map 3 shows some of the intermediate features involved in the creation of the limits feature
                            class. Creating the end node points was more challenging than expected due to some
                            peculiarities of the network processing tools in QGIS. Undoubtedly, this would have been
                            easier in ArcGIS Pro. However, I found a work around and eventually was able to extract the
                            points necessary for the next step: using the spatially sort points tool. As can be seen in
                            map 3, the end nodes are labelled with their order relative to an arbitrary starting point
                            (0). From this point, it's a simple matter of using the Points to Path and Lines to Polygon
                            tools. Sometimes the resulting lines need some manual cleaning but all in all, this method
                            is faster than creating each line manually. </p>
