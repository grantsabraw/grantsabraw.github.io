                        <p>This project was part of a BCIT cartography course and involved designing a thematic map with
                            the freedom of choosing the geographic area, map theme, data, feature classes, and
                            specifications like symbology, data classification, colours, symbols, annotation, etc.</p>
                        <p>While brainstorming ideas for this project I knew I wanted to do
                            something with census data. The issue of housing affordability is rather prominent and
                            seemed like it would make an interesting theme. Below, as you can see, I used dissemination
                            areas (which are the smallest geographic areas for census data) for the main
                            map and census tracts for the key map, and chose to display the
                            particular metric of percentage of households that spend more than 30% of their income on
                            shelter costs which includes both renters and owners.</p>
                        <p>An interesting feature of this dataset
                            is how Stanley Park shows up in the 40-50% range. Within that area there are some
                            residential buildings but they are located next to adjacent census areas which gives a false
                            impression that the entire park is populated with houses. I decided to leave Stanley Park in
                            the final dataset for the sake of accurately representing the source data. Though if I were
                            to do it again I think I would exclude Stanley Park or modify the polygon to overlap with
                            the real locations of shelters within that area. Also, green coloured roads might seem like
                            an odd
                            choice but they contrast well with the orange/red polygons</p>
                        <p>Although much of the areas
                            are lightly coloured, indicating that only 10-30% of households are affected, that
                            still seems like a rather significant proportion which comes at no surprise given the
                            reputation Vancouver has with respect to housing affordability. It will be interesting to
                            see how data from the next census compares. However, I suspect it will show a worsening
                            trend. </p>
